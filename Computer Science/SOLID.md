## Single-responsibility principle

"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change". In other words, ever class should only have one responsibility.

## Open-closed principle

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov subtitution principle

"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

## Interface segregation principle

"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

## Dependency inversion principle
