JPA - how does it relate to hibernate?
- [SO Article talking about this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55127878/using-spring-data-jpa-instead-of-hibernate#:~:text=By%20default%20it's%20hibernate%2C%20but,to%20openJPA%2C%20toplink%20and%20others.&text=As%20you%20said%2C%20spring%2Ddata,data%2Djpa%20alone%20as%20well%3F)
    - "The purpose of `spring data` is to simplify or remove the DAO (Data Access Object) layerimplementations entirely. "
    - Hibernate implements the JPA Spec
    - `Spring-data-jpa` uses Hibernate under the hood

- From Spring: "There are multiple repository implementations besides JPA. You can use Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Data GemFire, Spring Data Cassandra, etc. For this tutorial, weâ€™ll stick with JPA."
