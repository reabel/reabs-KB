### Front-End Development:

1. **What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?**
   - **Answer:** CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web, while Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system. Grid is best suited for overall page layout, and Flexbox is ideal for distributing items within a container.

2. **Explain the purpose of responsive web design.**
   - **Answer:** Responsive web design ensures that a website's layout and content adapt to various screen sizes and devices. This is achieved through techniques like flexible grids, media queries, and responsive images.

3. **What is the importance of the viewport meta tag in a web page?**
   - **Answer:** The viewport meta tag controls the width and scaling of the viewport on a mobile browser. It is crucial for ensuring that websites look and behave well on different devices.

### Back-End Development:

4. **Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming.**
   - **Answer:** In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after the other in a sequential order. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed independently, and the program doesn't wait for a task to complete before moving on.

5. **What is the purpose of middleware in Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request, response, and next middleware function. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

6. **How does RESTful API differ from GraphQL?**
   - **Answer:** RESTful APIs use a fixed structure for data retrieval and updates, while GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need. GraphQL offers more flexibility in data retrieval and reduces over-fetching and under-fetching.

### Database:

7. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
   - **Answer:** SQL databases are relational and use a structured query language, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and provide a more flexible schema. SQL databases are suitable for complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases are often used for large-scale, distributed data with varying structures.

8. **Explain the concept of database indexing.**
   - **Answer:** Indexing is a database optimization technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It involves creating a data structure (an index) to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.

### General Software Development:

9. **What is version control, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows collaboration among developers, tracks changes, and helps in debugging and rollback to previous versions.

10. **How do you ensure the security of a web application?**
    - **Answer:** Security measures include input validation, encryption (SSL/TLS), secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, regular security audits, and staying informed about the latest security threats and best practices.

11. **Describe the process of deploying a web application.**
    - **Answer:** The deployment process involves preparing the application for production, configuring servers, setting up databases, and transferring code to the production environment. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI can automate this process.
