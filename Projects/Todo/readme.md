# Todo App (because every dev needs their own)

This is a placeholder for a basic todo app. instead of containing it within a seperate sandbox, the todo app may have a few specific imiplemenations and will be more about building out the application than understanding a certain language / framework.

## Implementation plan

### Frontend

- to start we'll probably do the todo app as react / next, but might expand or switch a later date

### Backend

- probably Java or Kotlin to start.
- Spring boot / framework (since kotlin can apparently work with this.)

### Database?

TBD
