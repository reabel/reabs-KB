## Android Auto Project

Since I've now got some basic experience with Kotlin, it would be nice to expand upon it with a relevant project on the android platform. It would be fun to experiment with the android auto environment and see what kind of car-friend application design and development I can come up with. This project is inspired with a job posting I saw on LinkedIn.

## Case Studies

This is a list of skunkwork projects that could graduate to my portfolio once they acheive a relatively stable state.

- Car appointment scheduler
  - would require API that returns make / models of cars
- Faux Email client
  - use AI or similar to occasionally generate random email
