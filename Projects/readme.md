## Android Auto Project

Since I've now got some basic experience with Kotlin, it would be nice to expand upon it with a relevant project on the android platform. It would be fun to experiment with the android auto environment and see what kind of car-friend application design and development I can come up with. This project is inspired with a job posting I saw on LinkedIn.
