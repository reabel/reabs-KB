# Reabel

## Who am I?

I'm a full-strack developer from Eastern Ontario, Canada.

## What do I do

-[ReabelDesign](https://reabeldesign.com) is my main portfolio website.
-[Reabelx](http://reabelx.com) is my [skunkworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project) where new projects are tested out.

Sometimes, I may refer to a general project to RXD, where the project is intended to be a combo of both, one day being preseted on the Reabel Design page.
