# JavaScript CoderPad Interview Study Plan

## 4-Week Study Plan (60–90 min/day)

### Week 1: Core JavaScript Mastery
- Data types, scope, closures, hoisting, `this`, prototypes, async (`Promise`, `async/await`).
- Daily: 2 easy + 1 medium coding problem in plain JavaScript (no libraries).

### Week 2: Problem-Solving Patterns
- Arrays/strings, hash maps, two pointers, sliding window, stacks/queues, recursion.
- Daily: 1 pattern review + 2 timed problems (20–30 min each).

### Week 3: CoderPad Simulation
- 3 mock interviews this week: explain approach first, then code, then test out loud.
- Practice writing clean functions, edge cases, and quick complexity analysis (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`).

### Week 4: Interview Polish
- Focus on weak areas found in mocks.
- 30–45 min behavioral prep (project stories, tradeoffs, debugging examples).
- 2 full mock sessions under real timing constraints.

## Daily Session Template (75 min)
- 10 min: review one JavaScript concept
- 40 min: one timed coding challenge
- 15 min: optimize + refactor
- 10 min: verbal walkthrough + complexity explanation

## CoderPad-Specific Tips
- Start by clarifying requirements and constraints before coding.
- Write a few test cases first (normal, edge, empty/null-ish).
- Narrate your thought process continuously.
- Prefer simple, correct solutions first; optimize second.
- Leave 3–5 minutes to run through examples and fix naming/readability.

## High-Value Topics to Prioritize
- Closures + scope chain
- Event loop + microtask vs macrotask basics
- Array/object manipulation without helper libraries
- Recursion vs iteration tradeoffs
- Time/space complexity communication
