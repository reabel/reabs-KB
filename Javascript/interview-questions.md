## Questions w/ Answers

### Basic Concepts:

1. **What is JavaScript?**

   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages.

2. **Differentiate between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript.**

   - `undefined` is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, while `null` is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

3. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**

   - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

   > TODO: Explain what the benefits of scoping are.

   > Also note that Hoisting is a default behaviour in javascript. As such, if you declare a variable after it's already been used, you won't have a compilation issue.

4. **What is the purpose of the `use strict` directive in JavaScript?**
   - `"use strict";` is a pragma that enables a strict mode in JavaScript, catching common coding errors and preventing the use of certain error-prone features.

### Data Types and Variables:

5. **What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?**

   - The primitive data types in JavaScript are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `symbol`.

6. **How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?**

   - You can use the `typeof` operator to check the data type of a variable.

   ```javascript
   const test = "hi there";
   typeof test; // returns string
   typeof test === "string"; // true
   ```

7. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` for variable declaration?**

   - `let` and `const` have block-level scope, while `var` has function-level scope. `const` is a constant and cannot be reassigned after declaration.

8. **Explain the concept of scope in JavaScript.**

   - Scope refers to the context in which variables are declared. JavaScript has function scope and block scope.

   > Function vs. block https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21772317/difference-between-function-level-scope-and-block-level-scope

   > Prior to ES6 JS only had function scope.
   > Local and Global scope are definitely a thing though
   > Local being held to function, Global being defined outside of one so accessable everywhere

### Functions:

9. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**

   - A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished execution.
   - [Closures on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

10. **Describe the differences between function declarations and function expressions.**

    - Function declarations are hoisted and can be called before their declaration, while function expressions are not hoisted.

11. **Explain the concept of callbacks in JavaScript.**

    - Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function to be executed later, often used in asynchronous operations.

12. **What is the purpose of the `bind` method in JavaScript?**
    - The `bind` method creates a new function with a specified `this` value and initial arguments, allowing you to set the context for a function.

### Objects and Prototypes:

13. **How are objects created in JavaScript?**

    - Objects can be created using object literals (`{}`), the `Object` constructor, or by using constructor functions.

14. **Explain the prototype chain in JavaScript.**

    - The prototype chain is a mechanism where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype, forming a chain of linked objects.

15. **What is the difference between `Object.create()` and the constructor pattern for creating objects?**
    - `Object.create()` creates an object with a specified prototype, while the constructor pattern involves defining a function and using the `new` keyword.

### ES6 Features:

16. **Describe the new features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).**

    - ES6 introduced features like `let` and `const` for variable declaration, arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, and more.

17. **Explain the significance of the `let` and `const` keywords in ES6.**

    - `let` and `const` provide block-scoped variable declarations, addressing some of the issues with `var`.

18. **What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**
    - Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax and do not bind their own `this` value.

### Asynchronous JavaScript:

19. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

    - The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations by managing the execution of code in a non-blocking way.

20. **How does Promises help in handling asynchronous operations?**

    - Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code, allowing you to work with success and error callbacks in a more structured manner.

21. **Explain the differences between callbacks and Promises.**
    - Callbacks and Promises both handle asynchronous operations, but Promises provide better readability and error handling through the use of `then` and `catch` methods.

### DOM Manipulation:

22. **How do you select elements in the DOM using JavaScript?**

    - Elements in the DOM can be selected using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.

23. **Explain the concept of event delegation.**

    - Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor, rather than individual elements, and using event propagation to handle events for multiple elements.

24. **What is the purpose of the `addEventListener` method?**
    - The `addEventListener` method is used to attach an event handler function to an HTML element, enabling the execution of code in response to events like clicks or keypresses.

### Error Handling:

25. **What is the purpose of the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks in JavaScript?**

    - These blocks are used for handling exceptions. Code in the `try` block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is caught in the `catch` block. The `finally` block always executes.

26. **Explain the difference between the `throw` statement and the `throw` keyword in JavaScript.**
    - The `throw` statement is used to generate an exception, while the `throw` keyword is used within a `catch` block to re-throw an exception.

### Miscellaneous:

27. **How do you check for the existence of a property in an object?**

    - You can use the `in` operator or the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if an object has a specific property.

28. **Describe the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript.**

    - `==` performs type [coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion), while `===` checks both value and type without coercion.

29. **What is the purpose of the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects in web development?**
    - These objects provide a way to store key-value pairs in a user's browser. `localStorage` persists data even after the browser is closed, while `sessionStorage` persists data for the duration of a page session.

### Others

> What will be the output of this code? false, or true?

`console.log(false == '0');`

A: true

_Reason: In this situation, the abstract equality comparison algorithm is used, aka type-coercing equality check. What it does is converting the values as long as possible, until they match in type and can be compared strictly._

```js
// first step
false = '0'

// second step
Number(false) == '0' -> 0 == '0'

// third
0 == '0' -> 0 == Number('0')

//fourth
0 == 0 -> 0 === 0 -> true
```

> What will be the output of this code?

`console.log(String.raw`HelloTwitter\nworld`);`

"HelloTwitter\nworld"

_Reason: String.raw takes template literals, processing all substitutions (eh ${something}), but ignoring "escape-sequences"._

> Expected output of `console.log(typeof typeof 1)`?

`string`

_Reason: the code will be evaluated right to left, so we'll see "number", which is a string_

> Expected output of `console.log(('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase());`

`"banana"`

_Reason: What actually happens here is the following: The plus operator is defined for numbers and strings and as soon as a string is present on either the left or right side, a string concatenation is perfomed:_

```js
// 1st step
'b' + 'a' -> 'ba'
// 2nd step
'ba' + + 'a' // wait a second!
```

_The two `+ +` actually indicate a prefix-operator, and not a classical plus. This converts a right-side argument to a number, but converting 'a' to a number produce "NaN"_

```js
// 1st step
'b' + 'a' -> 'ba'
// 2nd step
'ba' + + 'a' -> 'ba' + NaN -> 'baNaN'
// 3rd step
'baNaN' + 'a' -> 'baNaNa'
// 4th step
'baNaNa'.toLowerCase() -> 'banana'
```

> Expected output of: `console.log(018 - 015);`

`5`

_(note, only works in non-strict mode) Reason: in earlier versions of JS, a leading 0 on a number marks it as an octal(base 8) number. because `018` isn't a valid octal number it's treated as base 10 (`18`). `015` is valid, which converts to 13. Therefore the result will be `18- 13 -> 5`_

> Expected output of `console.log(1 +  "2" + "2");`

`122`

_Same as before, JS will evaluate this right to left, so the initial type is string_

> Expected output of the following:

```js
const numbers = [33, 2, 8];
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers[1]);
```

`Array.prototype.sort` decides to convert the values of the array to string, which then sorts in _lexicograpghic_ order. This will start at position 0 of the string, which means 3 comes before 8. This results in `["2", "33", "8"].

> Expected output of `console.log("This is a string." instanceof String);`

`false`

_Reason: `"This is a string"` is actually a primitive string and not a String Object. if it was written in `new String("This is a string.")` then it would be `true`_

What instanceof actually does is checking if the String constructor is nested within the prototype chain of the value provided.

> Expected output of `console.log(typeof NaN);`?

`number`

NaN is typesafe, so you'll always get a number.
