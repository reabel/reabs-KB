### 1. **What is React?**

- **Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of an application efficiently.

### 2. **Explain JSX in React.**

- **Answer:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a JavaScript file, making it easier to visualize the structure of UI components.

### 3. **What is the significance of Virtual DOM in React?**

- **Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulations to the DOM. When the state of a component changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM and then calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM.

### 4. **Explain the concept of state in React.**

- **Answer:** The state in React is an object that represents the parts of a component that can change over time. It is managed internally by the component and can be modified using the `setState` method. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component.

### 5. **What is the difference between state and props in React?**

- **Answer:** Props are inputs to a component that are passed from its parent component, and they are immutable. State, on the other hand, is managed within a component and can change over time.

### 6. **Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components.**

- **Answer:** Controlled components are components whose state is controlled by React. They take their current value through props and notify changes through callbacks. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, store their state in the DOM, and their state is not controlled by React.

### 7. **What is the significance of keys in React lists?**

- **Answer:** Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a React list. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. This helps in efficient rendering and updating of the UI.

### 8. **Explain the lifecycle methods of a React component.**

- **Answer:** React components go through three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. The lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`, among others.

### 9. **What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in React?**

- **Answer:** The `useEffect` hook in React is used for handling side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

### 10. **What are React Hooks?**

- **Answer:** React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features previously available only in class components.

### 11. **Explain the difference between class components and functional components.**

- **Answer:** Class components use ES6 classes and have a full feature set including lifecycle methods and local state. Functional components are simpler and rely on functional programming concepts. With the introduction of hooks, functional components can now manage state and lifecycle methods.

### 12. **What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in React?**

- **Answer:** The `useState` hook is used in functional components to add state variables and their updating functions. It allows functional components to have local state.

### 13. **How does React Router work?**

- **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation and routing in a React application. It provides components like `BrowserRouter` and `Route` that allow developers to create single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

### 14. **What are Higher Order Components (HOCs)?**

- **Answer:** Higher Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and to modify the behavior of components.

### 15. **Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.**

- **Answer:** Lifting state up is the practice of moving the state from a lower-level component to a higher-level component in the component hierarchy. This is done to share state between components and maintain a single source of truth.
