### What is React?

- **Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of an application efficiently.

### Explain JSX in React.

- **Answer:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a JavaScript file, making it easier to visualize the structure of UI components.

### What is the significance of Virtual DOM in React?

- **Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulations to the DOM. When the state of a component changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM and then calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM.

### Explain the concept of state in React.

- **Answer:** The state in React is an object that represents the parts of a component that can change over time. It is managed internally by the component and can be modified using the `setState` method. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component.

### What is the difference between state and props in React?

- **Answer:** Props are inputs to a component that are passed from its parent component, and they are immutable. State, on the other hand, is managed within a component and can change over time.

### Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components.

- **Answer:** Controlled components are components whose state is controlled by React. They take their current value through props and notify changes through callbacks. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, store their state in the DOM, and their state is not controlled by React.

### What is the significance of keys in React lists?

- **Answer:** Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a React list. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. This helps in efficient rendering and updating of the UI.

### Explain the lifecycle methods of a React component.

- **Answer:** React components go through three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. The lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`, among others.

### What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in React?

- **Answer:** The `useEffect` hook in React is used for handling side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

### What are React Hooks?

- **Answer:** React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features previously available only in class components.

### Explain the difference between class components and functional components.

- **Answer:** Class components use ES6 classes and have a full feature set including lifecycle methods and local state. Functional components are simpler and rely on functional programming concepts. With the introduction of hooks, functional components can now manage state and lifecycle methods.

### What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in React?

- **Answer:** The `useState` hook is used in functional components to add state variables and their updating functions. It allows functional components to have local state.

### How does React Router work?

- **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation and routing in a React application. It provides components like `BrowserRouter` and `Route` that allow developers to create single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

### What are Higher Order Components (HOCs)?

- **Answer:** Higher Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and to modify the behavior of components.

### Explain the concept of lifting state up in React

- **Answer:** Lifting state up is the practice of moving the state from a lower-level component to a higher-level component in the component hierarchy. This is done to share state between components and maintain a single source of truth.

### Question 25

> Why should you avoid copying the values of props into a component's state?

Because that would create two instances of the same state that could become out of sync

## Hooks

### What are React Hooks?

- **Answer:** React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features without writing a class component. They were introduced in React 16.8 to enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components.

### What problem do React Hooks solve?

- **Answer:** React Hooks solve the problem of code duplication and complexity by allowing stateful logic to be reused across multiple components without the need for class components or higher-order components.

### What is the `useState` hook used for?

- **Answer:** The `useState` hook is used to add state variables to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. For example:
  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  ```

### How do you use the `useEffect` hook?

- **Answer:** The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after every render and can be used to fetch data, subscribe to events, or update the DOM. For example:
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);
  ```

### What is the purpose of the second argument in `useEffect`?

- **Answer:** The second argument in the `useEffect` hook is an array of dependencies. It specifies the values that the effect depends on. The effect will only re-run if one of the dependencies has changed.

### What is the `useContext` hook used for?

- **Answer:** The `useContext` hook is used to consume values from React context in functional components. It allows components to access context values without using the `Context.Consumer` component. For example:
  ```javascript
  const value = useContext(MyContext);
  ```

### What is the purpose of the `useReducer` hook?

- **Answer:** The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to `useState` that allows you to manage complex state logic in functional components. It is often used when the state transitions depend on the previous state or when the logic is more complex than simple updates.

### How do you create a custom hook in React?

- **Answer:** To create a custom hook, you simply write a JavaScript function that starts with the word `use` and uses other hooks inside it. Custom hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic across different components. For example:

  ```javascript
  function useWindowSize() {
    const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
      width: window.innerWidth,
      height: window.innerHeight,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
      const handleResize = () => {
        setWindowSize({
          width: window.innerWidth,
          height: window.innerHeight,
        });
      };

      window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
      return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    }, []);

    return windowSize;
  }
  ```

### What is the `useCallback` hook used for?

- **Answer:** The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize functions in functional components. It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for optimizing performance in components that rely on callbacks.

### Explain the purpose of the `useMemo` hook

    - **Answer:** The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of expensive calculations in functional components. It returns a memoized value that only changes when one of the dependencies has changed. This can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### What is the `useRef` hook used for?

    - **Answer:** The `useRef` hook is used to create mutable references that persist across renders in functional components. It returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument. It is often used to access DOM elements or to store mutable values without triggering a re-render.

### How do you conditionally apply React Hooks?

    - **Answer:** You can conditionally apply React Hooks by using them inside conditionals, loops, or other JavaScript expressions. However, React Hooks must be called at the top level of your component, not inside nested functions or blocks.

### What are the rules of hooks in React?

    - **Answer:** The rules of hooks in React are:
      1. Hooks should only be called at the top level of your components or custom hooks, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
      2. Hooks should only be called from functional components or custom hooks, not from regular JavaScript functions.
      3. Hooks should have consistent order and should not be conditionally applied.

### What are the benefits of using React Hooks?

    - **Answer:** Some benefits of using React Hooks include:
      - Simplified state management and lifecycle logic in functional components
      - Reusability of stateful logic with custom hooks
      - Improved code readability and maintainability
      - Reduction of class component boilerplate code

### Can you use React Hooks in class components?

    - **Answer:** No, React Hooks are designed to be used in functional components or custom hooks. They cannot be used in class components. If you need to use state or lifecycle methods in a class component, you should use the traditional class-based approach.

These questions should give you a good understanding of React Hooks and help you prepare for interviews focused on React development. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need clarification on any topic!
