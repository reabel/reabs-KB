# Interview Questions - Express.js

> These questions have been generated by ChatGPT and tweaked by me.

### 1. **What is Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is designed to make the process of building web applications and APIs with Node.js easier.

### 2. **Explain middleware in the context of Express.js.**

- **Answer:** Middleware in Express.js are functions that have access to the request, response, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can modify the request, response objects, or end the request-response cycle.

### 3. **How does routing work in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Express.js uses a routing system to define routes for handling different HTTP requests and URLs. Routes are defined using methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc., and they are associated with specific request handlers.

### 4. **What is the purpose of the `app.use` function in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** The `app.use` function is used to mount middleware in Express.js. It specifies that the middleware function should be executed for every request to the server.

### 5. **Explain the difference between `app.get()` and `app.use()` in Express.js.**

- **Answer:** `app.get()` is used for handling HTTP GET requests, while `app.use()` is a more general-purpose method for mounting middleware, which can be used for all types of HTTP requests.

### 6. **What is the significance of the `next` function in Express.js middleware?**

- **Answer:** The `next` function is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. It is typically called within a middleware function to indicate that the middleware has completed its processing and the request should be passed to the next middleware.

### 7. **How can you handle route parameters in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Route parameters are specified in a route pattern with a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name. They can be accessed in the request handler using `req.params`.

### 8. **Explain the purpose of the `body-parser` middleware in Express.js.**

- **Answer:** `body-parser` is a middleware used to parse the body of incoming HTTP requests. It is commonly used to extract form data, JSON, or other types of payloads from the request body.

### 9. **What is the purpose of the `express.Router` class in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** The `express.Router` class is used to create modular, mountable route handlers. It is often used to structure the routes in a more organized way.

### 10. **Explain the concept of middleware chaining in Express.js.**

- **Answer:** Middleware chaining in Express.js involves using multiple middleware functions in a specific order. Each middleware function can modify the request or response and pass control to the next middleware using the `next` function.

### 11. **What is the purpose of the `static` middleware in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** The `static` middleware is used to serve static files, such as HTML, images, CSS, and JavaScript files, directly from a specified directory.

### 12. **How can you handle errors in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Error handling in Express.js involves using middleware with four parameters (err, req, res, next). When an error occurs, the middleware with four parameters is invoked, and the `next` function is used to pass control to the next error-handling middleware.

### 13. **What is the role of the `res.send()` function in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** The `res.send()` function is used to send a response to the client. It can send various types of responses, including strings, JSON objects, and HTML.

### 14. **Explain the difference between `app.listen` and `app.set` in Express.js.**

- **Answer:** `app.listen` is used to start the Express application and make it listen for incoming requests on a specific port. `app.set` is used to configure application settings, such as the view engine, and is not related to starting the server.

### 15. **How can you handle CORS in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be handled in Express.js by using the `cors` middleware. It enables the server to include appropriate headers in the response to allow or deny cross-origin requests.
