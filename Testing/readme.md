## Linters / Formatters

Linters help with ensuring consistency throughout the codebase, but also come in handy at merge / build time to catch issues that might otherwise break the build (such as syntax errors).

### Example Linters: 
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/)
Formatters are extensions / scripts that will automatically format your code given a spec.

## Code Smells

"Code Smells" are an indication that the quality of some code is off, either in relation in general rules and practices, or compared to standard design principals. 

Certain Tools exist such as SonarQube that can detect certain deviances from standard practices that can end up harming the end result / execution of code.
