# Udemy 

Over the course of the last several years, I've made it a habit to purchase the occasional course on Udemy while sales were on. Here I'm providing a list of the courses and relevant topics they've touched on.

## [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) - Stephen Grider

This course has been updated a few times over the years and I really enjoyed how the author presented the topics

### Relevant Topics

- [Javascript](../Javascript/readme.md)
- [React](../Javascript/react/readme.md)
- JSX
- Reusable Components
- "Don't Mutate that state"
- Event Handling
- Hooks
    - useEffect
    - useContext

### A Note about Redux

It appears that the presence of redux within this course is _drastically_ reduced in favour of context use. I still need to review this further but there's a few decent resources out there that I'll link here.
