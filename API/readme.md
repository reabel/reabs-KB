# API Development

## Starting Points

- APIs are a means for an "application or service to access a resource within another application or service" (from [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis)).
- The accessor is called the client, where the accessee is the server.
- General, non-strict(agnostic) language / format (as opposed to SOAP or XML-RPC).

### Design Principals

- Uniform Interface
- Client-server decoupling
- Statelessness
- Cacheability
- Layered System Architectuire
- Code on demand(optional)

## True REST

## OpenAPI Spec

- [Swagger Spec (3.0.2)](https://swagger.io/specification/)
- [Open API Spec 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0)
- [Learn Open API](https://learn.openapis.org/)

## Security

### External APIs

- Rate Limiting
- Input sanitization

### Internal APIs

- IP Whitelisting
